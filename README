This repo includes a variety of SQL queries based off sample datasets, included here in .csv format for reproducibility.

My experience is with IBM Db2 SQL through a variety of IDEs as well as SAS. I'll exclude any functions that aren't base
SQL standard, as well as additional code that might compromise organizational secrecy for current/former employers. 

What this means is that the code I provide here wouldn't run in, say, SAS directly without additional parameters, 
i.e. connecting to Db2; but all code has been tested and successfully implemented.

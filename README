This repo includes a variety of SQL queries based off of sample datasets, included here in .csv format for reproducibility.

My experience is with IBM Db2 SQL through a variety of IDEs as well as SAS. I'll try and avoid any functions that aren't base SQL standard.

All code has been tested and successfully implemented.
